                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What I&apos;m Writing</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">My stories on Kindle Vella are really starting to take shape.  Some days I feel like I can&apos;t type the words fast enough, and I&apos;m so excited for you to take this journey with me.  I&apos;m seriously considering releasing two episodes 
                a week instead of just one - if I can pull it off.  Please message me if you would like to see more content or if you&apos;re happy with one episode a week.  If my math is correct, that would mean writing 3000-4000 words a day!  Since I&apos;m new at writing, I have no idea 
                if that is too much or not enough.  If there are any other new or experienced writers out there, I would love to hear your thoughts.  How many words do you typically try to write in a day?  Is there some point where you think the quality of your writing starts to fall off? 
                I have so many ideas running through my head right now.  I keep wondering if they will slow down at some point.</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">Anyway, here are the links to my Kindle Vella stories if you haven&apos;t found them already: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B242TJWR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">The Seasoned Witch</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B2941LDQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">The Haunting of Ellory May</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B295551X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">The Seer</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B2BWFF2H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">Spellbound: Tales of Myst Haven</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B2CJL1P9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">The S.P.I.R.I.T.

                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    I mentioned in my <Link to='/newsletter2' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">last newsletter</Link> that I&apos;m working on a new story about a society of werewolves facing discrimination from the human 
                    world.  I plan for it to be a southern gothic horror and politcal mystery tied up into one.  I have been doing a lot of research lately on the types of werewolf novels out there, and I&apos;m noticing that the vast majority of them fall in the paranormal 
                    romance category.  My story is going to be totally different from that, so I hope it will find it&apos;s own fanbase.  I have always enjoyed supernatural horror and classic whodunnit mysteries, so I was hoping to join the two genres with this series.  Maybe 
                    there are other readers out there who have the kind of strange taste that I do.  Once again, I would love to hear from you about your taste in reading.  If you&apos;re here, you probably like supernatural fantasy, but I would love to hear about the microgenres 
                    that you like.  Reach out on social media so we can discuss!

                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What I&apos;m Reading - And Watching</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    I can never resist the opportunity to read books that are made into movies or television series so I can compare and contrast the two.  In this case, I&apos;m reading The Umbrella Academy comic books to go along with the recently released Season 3 on Netflix.  I 
                    was probably a little too excited to learn that they are available through my Kindle Unlimited subscription.  That service is worth every penny.  I&apos;ve only read the first issue so far, but I must say I love it just as much as the show.  These comics are going to keep me occupied 
                    for a while - but I&apos;ll be done binging the show tonight.  I heard that the hotel that&apos;s featured in the third season is a lot cooler in the comics.  I can&apos;t wait to find out!
