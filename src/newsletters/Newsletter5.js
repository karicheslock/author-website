                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What I&apos;m Writing</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">I&apos;m very excited to announce that I recently published the first few episodes of The Lycan Saga, my new series on Kindle Vella!  Please click <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B83N5SP2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">here</a> to start reading  
                this story.  And don&apos;t forget to click Follow to receive notifications when a new episode is released.  If you like werewolves, mysteries, and southern cooking this story is definitely for you.  I have set a lofty goal of trying to include a recipe with each 
                episode - typically something that would come out of a southern kitchen - and I gotta tell ya, I&apos;m really enjoying it so far.  It&apos;s been a challenge to incorporate something food related into each episode so that I can include a recipe for it at the end, but 
                I think I&apos;m making it work.  Oh, and there&apos;s the whole werewolf/mystery thing I&apos;ve got going as well.  If everything keeps going as planned, this may be my favorite series to write.  But that doesn&apos;t mean the others aren&apos;t really fun 
                to write, too.  I hope you check out all of them and find something you like ðŸ¤“.</p>

                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What I&apos;m Reading</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    The Final Girl Support Group by Grady Hendrix.  I&apos;ve also read The Southern Book Club&apos;s Guide to Slaying Vampires by the same author. Both are really great reads.  I like The Final Girl Support Group because I have always been a huge horror movie nut, and it 
                    doesn&apos;t get any better than a classic slasher flick - or if you subscribe to Shudder like me, you call them Slashics.  This book explores the final girl trope in a new and clever way by assuming all the Slashics were based on real people.  And now all those final 
                    girls have to try and find a way to live normal lives.  You will recognize the characters in this book pretty quickly if you&apos;ve spent countless hours watching horror films, and that&apos;s what makes this book so relatable.  I highly recommend it.
