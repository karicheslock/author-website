                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">I am continuing my work on the five stories I have previously outlined, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B242TJWR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">The Seasoned Witch</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B2941LDQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">The Haunting of Ellory May</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B295551X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">The Seer</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B2BWFF2H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">Spellbound: Tales of Myst Haven</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B2CJL1P9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">The S.P.I.R.I.T. Adventures</a>.</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    Each story is at a really exciting stage, and I&apos;m just as thrilled as you are - hopefully - to see what happens with each of them.  I began each story with only a loose idea of where I wanted each one to go, so I&apos;m 
                    actually surprising myself as I write them.  The characters are evolving on the page right in front of me, and I love getting to know them.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    I&apos;m also pleased to announce that I have another story that I&apos;m working on that I will be publishing soon.  This time I will be reaching down into my southern roots and cooking up a little southern gothic horror with a werewolf twist.  The general 
                    story idea I have so far is about a werewolf pack living in the southern part of the Appalachian trail who are in constant conflict with the human society surrouding them.  I&apos;m planning for it to be a sort of political parallel to the prejudices that are 
                    still occuring in our society today.  It will be something of a classic slasher horror with a political twist, served deep fried with a side of gravy.

                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What I&apos;m Reading</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    I just started reading The Blessing Way by Tony Hillerman.  If you haven&apos;t heard of Tony Hillerman, I highly recommend reading his books.  I read a number of his books years ago, but it&apos;s been a while, to the point that I don&apos;t remember 
                    all of the details and it&apos;s like reading them anew.   His novels are supernatural mysteries set in Navajo country, and are now being made into a television series called Dark Winds on AMC.  I saw the first episode and I was immediately 
                    hooked.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">    
                    I have a bit of Native American blood myself.  My grandfather&apos;s grandmother was Cherokee and most of my family members still live on the same land where her tribe lived at the base of the Appalachian trail in Alabama, so I am utterly 
                    fascinated with Native American culture.  There is an inherent mysticism in everything they do and the belief in magic and spirits and forces beyond our world permeate every aspect of their culture.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    There&apos;s a funny side effect of growing up on Native American land.  You hear so many tales of ghosts and spirits and the afterlife that you become unafraid of them.  I guess that&apos;s why I like writing about them so much.  And reading about them, of course.
                </p>
                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What You&apos;re Writing</p>
