                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What I&apos;m Writing</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">I have yet another new series in the works and I&apos;m super excited about it.  I know I already have six series going right now, but I just can&apos;t pass up an idea if one comes along.  My idea is still in its preliminary stages but 
                I&apos;m hoping to have something published and available either later this month or early next month.  This one is going to be about a young girl who discovers she has a superpower, which is something I have wanted to write about for a while now.  This girl is going to discover that she has 
                the ability to write stories and have them come to life.  But there&apos;s a bad guy out there who wants to steal her powers and stop all the stories from being written.  It will be a battle of wills and a battle of words and I can&apos;t wait to see where it goes.  I&apos;m probably 
                going to write several stories within the main story which will be a fun and exciting challenge.  Follow me on social media for updates on this new series as they are available!</p>

                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What I&apos;m Reading</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    Skinwalker, Jane Yellowrock, Book 1 by Faith Hunter.  This story could not be more my taste.  It&apos;s about a skinwalker of Cherokee descent who is a shapeshifter and a vampire hunter.  Oh and it&apos;s set in the streets of New Orleans.  That pretty much ticks all my boxes 
                    as far as a good read that appeals to me.  This book has some interesting interludes where the main character transitions to her &apos;beast&apos; and the story is told from her perspective in a transitioned state.  So the language becomes simpler and the character&apos;s actions 
                    become more feral.  I like this sort of magic.  It challenges you to think beyond yourself and tap into your more animalistic nature.  It makes you wonder how you would behave if you had your own inner beast.  Anyway, it&apos;s a great story and I can&apos;t wait to continue the series.
