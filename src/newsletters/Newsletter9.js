                    Welcome to the ninth edition of the newsletter for C.K. Brandywine Publishing.  I want to start out by saying how happy I am that we have finally reached my favorite time of year!  Halloween!! üéÉüëªüíÄ‚ö∞Ô∏è My house is decorated and I'm staying up late every night 
                    eating bite size candy bars and watching horror movies.  Of course, I&apos;m supposed to be saving the candy bars for trick-or-treaters, but I&apos;m sure there will be some left by the time the big day rolls around.  At least, I hope there will be ü§ûü§ûü§û.

                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What I&apos;m Writing</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">  I&apos;m still working on completing my first five novels which will come out in early December if all goes well.  I&apos;m also still planning the release of my next series for Kindle Vella.  I&apos;m hoping to release the first 
                few episodes by the end of this month although that keeps getting pushed back.  It turns out that trying to write five novels at once - well, six if you count The Lycan Saga which will be coming out early next year - is pretty time-consuming.  But, I&apos;m still 
                going to find a way to do it.  The story is just too exciting to ignore.</p>
                <p>I have always wanted to write a novel about a young girl who finds out she has superpowers, so this will be my way to do it.  In case you missed my last newsletter, I am planning a series about 
                a little girl who discoveres that she has the power to make all the stories she writes come true.  Specifically, her characters will be able to come to life and exist in the real world.  I&apos;m planning a nemesis for her with epic battle scenes to come.  Stay tuned!!  
                The more I think about this series the more excited I get.</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">Anyway, here are the links to my other Kindle Vella stories if you haven&apos;t found them already: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B242TJWR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">The Seasoned Witch</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B2941LDQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">The Haunting of Ellory May</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B295551X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">The Seer</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B2BWFF2H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">Spellbound: Tales of Myst Haven</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/story/B0B2CJL1P9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-red-800 font-bold hover:text-green-900">The S.P.I.R.I.T.

                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What I&apos;m Reading</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    Pride and Prejudice and Zombies by Jane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith.  Yes, this book is exactly what it sounds like.  The original classic has been rewritten with zombies.  If you think about it, this may just be the perfect novel and I&apos;ll admit to being just 
                    a little bit jealous of the author who wrote it.  I mean, how great would it be to take a classic and add a spin to it?  Especially a supernatural spin like zombies.  It&apos;s books like these that can really inspire me to think of new ideas for my own writing.  I 
                    could spend all day thinking of <em>What If</em> scenarios to stretch my imagination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, the book is full of period drama and slasher gore.  What could be better?  I highly recommend it.  Oh, and there&apos;s a movie also which is just as good as the book.  Enjoy!
                </p>
