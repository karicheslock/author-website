                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What I&apos;m Writing</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">If you have been following my Facebook posts - and I hope that you have - you know by now that I&apos;ve been working on a new series called The Lycan Saga.  I&apos;m super excited about it, and I hope you will be too.  This is going to be 
                a story about werewolves, and I can&apos;t wait to start publishing it.  One of the reasons I&apos;m so excited about it is that it&apos;s not going to be your typical werewolf story.  First of all, there will be a strong female lead character.  &#40;If you have been reading 
                my other stories, you will notice that all of them have a strong female lead and I wanted to continue that with this story.&#41;  Secondly, these werewolves will be capable of magic, and not just shapeshifting magic.  Are werewolf witches already a thing?  If not, they 
                will be soon.  And lastly, my main character is the head chef at a bar and restaurant, so I plan to include a recipe of hers at the end of each chapter.  This story will be set in Appalachia, meaning the recipes will mostly be from the deep fried south.  So get ready to 
                chow down on some barbecue and cornbread alongside a fierce and loyal werewolf pack.  Oh, but look out for the locals.  They&apos;re not so friendly to those of the shapeshifting variety.</p>

                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    The Haunting of Leigh Harker by Darcy Coates.  Ok, so I couldn&apos;t resist a title so similar to one of my own stories, and I must say, I have absolutely zero regrets.  This was a great ghost story with a surprising twist that I didn&apos;t see coming.  I 
                    won&apos;t spoil anything, of course, but suffice it to say that I highly recommend this book.  Not only is it a great ghost story, it has a lot of heart and friendship and family and basically all of the good feels - besides the whole spirit at unrest thing.  
                    I love reading stories with a surprise twist.  It gets me thinking about my own writing and ways to improve it.  Anyway, check it out if you&apos;re looking for a good spooky story with some surprising feel good aspects to go along with it.
