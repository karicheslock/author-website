                    writing world.  I&apos;ve started with five stories that I&apos;m really excited about, and I have a few more in the works that I hope to be releasing soon.

                    To start out, I thought I would structure these newsletters with three recurring sections to keep you informed of everything going on in my world.  Specifically, What I&apos;m Writing, What I&apos;m Reading, and What You&apos;re Writing.  
                    The first two sections are self-explanatory.  For the last section, I will supply a writing prompt each week for you to flex your own fingers over the keyboard.  After all, creativity lives in all of us.  Perhaps you will find some 
                    inspiration here.  So without further adieuâ€¦
                </p>
                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What I&apos;m Writing</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">I now have five episodic stories that I&apos;m publishing on Kindle Vella.  I am adding a new episode to each one every week so you will never run out of content.  All of my stories are in the fantasy genre with a few different subgenres.</p>

And then she finds out that she herself may be a witch.  She also finds out that a lot of people are 
                    looking for her now that she has the long lost grimoires of Millicent Willoughby.  It will be up to her to figure out who she can trust.

One spirit in particular stands out to her.  A little girl who was found in an abandoned house with only a few clues to 
                    her identity or what happened to her.  Layla desperately wants to find out what happened to her and must figure out a way to relay information from the dead girl to the police without seeming like a crazy person or worse.

Adventures</a> is about a team of paranormal investigators, specifically the San Diego Paranormal Investigation and Research Initiative Team, who are attempting to bring in a little side hustle money while also proving thatâ€¦ drumroll, 
                    pleaseâ€¦ GHOSTS. ARE. REAL.  Their first case involves a single mother at her wits end trying to protect her teenage daughter from their seemingly haunted house.  S.P.I.R.I.T. must figure out what&apos;s going on so they can help these people.  Otherwise, they 
                    stand to make big fools of themselves.

                <p className=" mb-4 mt-4 text-2xl text-red-800 font-bold tracking-wide">What I&apos;m Reading</p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    The more I sit down and try to write, the more I appreciate the books that I read.  Meaning, now I know just how much work goes into writing a book.  I know a lot of you are probably avid readers.  I myself read anywhere from 75 to 100 books a year and can&apos;t 
                    stand to have less than five books in progress at any given time.  And so, I thought I would write this section in my newsletter to show my appreciation for other writers out there as well as to show you where I&apos;m drawing some of my own inspiration.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    Right now, I&apos;m reading, or rather listening to, Andrea Vernon and the Corporation for UltraHuman Protection by Alexander C. Kane.  I am listening to it on Audible but I think you can also find it on Kindle Unlimited.  In this particular case, 
                    however, I am going to specifically recommend listening to the audiobook version of it.  The narrator, Bahni Turpin, is just amazing.  She changes voices for the different characters seamlessly and adds a whole other layer to the enjoyment of 
                    this book.  It&apos;s a laugh-out-loud story of superheroes trying to save the world from an alien invasion.  It has to be one of the funniest science fiction books I&apos;ve ever read with some truly unforgettable characters.  The impressive list of 
                    superheroes alone is worth the read.  I highly recommend it, especially if you need something to provoke a belly laugh among all the doom and gloom in the world right now.
