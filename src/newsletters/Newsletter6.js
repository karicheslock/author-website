                <p className="mb-4 mt-4 leading-7">
                    Indexing by Seanan McGuire.  This book was appealing to me for many reasons.  First of all, it was originally published in episodes on Kindle and then released as a novel.  That gave me hope about my own series ðŸ˜Š.  Also, the subject matter is more than a little appealing.  It is 
                    an imaginative and gritty retelling of all the classic fairy tales.  Fairy tale characters are evil in this book.  They bring death and destruction for the sake of 'following their narrative'.  I love the idea of something intangible becoming tangible and this author seems 
                    to have nailed that concept.  It&apos;s really inspiring in terms of thinking more creatively about the world around you and different ways you can approach world building as a writer.  If a story becomes a living thing, then what happens?  It&apos;s a great concept.
                </p>
